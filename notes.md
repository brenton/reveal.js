## Why Bother?
A few weeks ago Red Hat hosted a talk by CompostNow.  In their promotional video one phrase really stuck with me, “Humans are insane”.  They made this claim in the light of the fact we’re the most intelligent species on the planet yet we’re the only ones who don’t know how to handle our own waste.  I’ll build on that and say we’re the one species insane enough to take anything good and totally mess it up for everyone.

Let’s consider plastic.  Modern computing, life saving medical procedures, energy efficient automobiles. You name it, it’s probably better now that it’s made of plastic.  Watch the Summit video from a few years back on open source prosthetics and tell me that doesn’t inspire you to see kids with 3D printed hands picking up toys for the first time.  Before I spend the next 30 minutes or so showing ways to use less plastic let’s just all take a moment to acknowledge the fact that pretty much our entire modern existence owes itself to this magical material.  In fact I'm certain I could praise plastic for the rest our time here and not offend anyone.  If that’s the case why am I getting bent out of shape like an empty tube of toothpaste over plastic.  Why would I or anyone recommend using less of it?

Well there’s the photos.  You know the ones.  Seabirds trapped in 6-pack rings.  A plastic bag digging deep into “Lucky” the platypus’ soft skin.  Disposable bags once carrying food are now themselves mistaken for food by living creatures big and small.  And then there’s allegations of a plastic patch the size of France floating somewhere in the pacific.

Until recently I assumed that couldn’t be my fault.  I would never hurt “Lucky”.  After all, I RECYCLED.  Just look at the overflowing blue bin in front of my house.  If recycling makes you green I’m basically kermit the frog.  Sadly, that’s another topic that came up in the CompostNow talk.  Recycling in general and especially plastic recycling in the US is in a bit of a jam right now.  From 2001 to 2018 pretty much all of the world’s plastic was recycled in China.  One day, without notice, that stopped. The Chinese National Sword, as the policy is called in English, struck the entire world and left us scrambling to find a place for all our plastic.  I can say with confidence, in the US the overwhelming majority of the plastic we put in blue bins is not being recycled.  How do I know this?  For starters, even when it was being sent to China, that was the case.  Now with only a few actual recycling facilities in this country we’re frantically trying to find other countries to take our garbage.  It shouldn’t be surprising that now that the entire world is looking for a new recycling vendor the price has gone up.  Having to pay money for something that had been previously generated revenues for a city isn’t exactly what elected officials enjoy admitting.  Sadly, if your town's recycling bill hasn't increased an order of magnitude you have a right to be suspicious.

In telling you this, I wish I could say learning about the damage I was causing to nature was enough shock me in to considering a few changes.  It actually wasn’t until I watched the film that ignited the National Sword backlash that things really hit home.  I saw a young girl cooking her rice by a fire fueled with my plastic bottles.  Her goats gorging themselves on the plastic wrapping from the toys I bought my kids last Christmas.  Brushing her teeth in putrid plastic water simply because I don’t like washing spoons.

You might think I’m taking things a bit far to suggest that I’m personally responsible for how another country chooses to deal with the problem.  That's indeed how I felt until I recently read The Color Of Law. Studies have shown the #1 indicator for the location low-income minority housing is proximity to toxic waste disposal.  There are many more that detail how the poor disproportionately suffer from the pollution of the rich.  If the plastic isn’t being handled in China, it’s moving to Ecuador or being smuggled to Malaysia.  Honestly my guess is that it will simply be burned in rural North Carolina as is done in Pennsylvania. How have I been able to ignore this?

For me I think it was at least twofold.  First, I come from a family who’s entire livelihood was based on the production of disposable diapers and potato chips.  Let’s just say I was raised under the notion of, “those people in the 3rd world should be thankful we’re creating jobs for them!”.  I understand economics and that, while true in some heartless sense, is a topic for an entirely different lunch and learn rant.

The second and more generally common reason I chose to ignore the problem was mere convenience. We just had our 4th child and it’s been a little overwhelming to say the least.  I generally don’t like joining buying clubs but this was the straw that broke the camel’s back and I shelled out for a Costco membership.  Add in free Whole Foods delivery and I’m basically living in Futurama.  All this newfound convenience came with some baggage in the form of a blue recycle bin that could no longer keep up with demand.  We had to stop consuming so much.

Now that I may have you really depressed.  I want to avoid the impression we’ve got this nailed.  I haven’t even figured out how to make some of these changes without coming across as a crunchy wannabe zero-waste jerk.  I can say that it’s now my family’s goal to raise awareness among our friends, teach our kids new ways to love others and, as a growing family, consume less of our planet than an average adult in this country.  I’m convinced anyone living above the poverty line can reduce their plastic consumption by 90% with only minor inconveniences.   Let’s talk about how!

## Refuse
* Saying No to things is the best way to save.
* If you don’t buy disposable plastic you will not be able to waste money at Costco, Amazon or Whole foods.  The non-plastic items are pretty much the same price everywhere.  The difference in price is usually due to quality or source.
* You will also save time.  Initially it will take time to find a solution to a problem, but once you do it will likely be your only option and will save tons of time.
* Buying local makes things easier
* OCCP sells many things not in plastic to fix your bike

## With your food
* Buy produce from local farmers
  * We have a two markets downtown and several deliver to Red Hat
* Meat from a butcher shop or Deli (pretty much everything else has to come in plastic by law)
  * Often cheaper than packaged
  * Seriously, I pretty much forgot the deli counter existed and that they have cheese.
  * They’ll probably want to at least wrap your food in paper due for sanitation reasons.  They won’t take your container in to their kitchen.
* Use Bulk bins for staples and bring your own containers.
  * You’ll eventually want to invest in similar size/weight containers.
* Reusable shopping bags, just put produce in the cloth bag directly.
* Buy milk in glass (paper cartons are lined with plastic)
  * We mostly turned ours into greek yogurt (saving a lot of money in exchange for a bit of time)

* Eating out
  * Bring your own plates, silverware, cloth napkins
  * Lots of online shops sells kits for this
  * This is challenging.  Mention Kabobi experience vs Greek Fiesta
  * Find and support places like “justsalad.com”
* Call ahead (Neomonde, Sosta)
  * You have to be fast.  Many places default to take out for drinks unless you explicitly request otherwise
* Make your own snacks (actually, get your kids to make them)
  * Zucchini chips are incredibly simple and awesome
  * Wrapping sandwiches in a cloth napkin instead of plastic sandwich bag
  * No plastic wrap on leftovers in the fridge...pyrex, mason jar, or a plate on top


## With your body:
* Wear cotton or wool or anything made from a material your grandparents would have used.
  * You can buy denim made here in NC and sewn in Raleigh.
  * Buy used clothing: there are a few consignment stores for kid's clothing and events at the fairgrounds and local clothing swaps.  Father & Son, Raleigh Vintage
* You can still buy laundry detergent in a carton (and it’s not hard to make)
* Baking Soda deodorant (or not)
* Plastic free shaving is actually hip now
* Silk dental floss is amazing
* Bamboo toothbrushes readily available (though some have plastic bristles)
* Biodegradable bandaids are a thing.
* Cloth diapers
  * Just about any clean cotton cloth can be a diaper.  No need to spend hundreds of dollars on designer diapers.  Who knew?

## With your work
* Bring my lunch, silverware, snacks
  * Really excited we might get a dishwashing service
* Stop accepting stickers, pens and many shirts
* Consider low waste catering options vs just buying a bunch of snacks wrapped in plastic
  * Eg, Have a local vendor bring popsicles on-site vs buying 200 at a store.  Anything not eating the vendor will be able to take back.

## Worthless junk
* Toys from grandparents, just politely say, “No thanks” (This is not always effective).
* Saying no to free things people are giving out that we won't use, ie kids library craft example, Mordecai Fairy Fair
* If it’s information just take a picture of it.

## DIY
* A word on DIY: Resist the temptation to DIY everything.  There’s a wealth of Zero Waste online stores now.
* Now, if for what you choose to DIY, you’ll find that most things use the same 10 ingredients or so.  Stock up on those.
* Switch hand soap for bars.  It’s shocking how expensive this stuff is in stores but thankfully my mother-in-law makes it.
* DIY lotion (we use to make some fancy stuff… turns out just raw shea butter is just as good IMO)
* DIY deodorant (just baking soda + a few drops of water)
* Dishwasher detergent
* Make our own toothpaste
  * This has helped me over the last year tremendously.  My dentist can attest.

## Reuse
* Local vendors are more willing to help your efforts.  
  * Charles Coats produce sells some things in plastic, but if you return it to him he’ll put it back to good use.
  * Jimmy sells eggs in Raleigh
* Glass jars are handy
  * For bringing your lunch
  * For making yogurt, toothpaste, gifts for others
* All food and yard waste is compostable.  This means we use less bags of any sort for trash.
  * The goal is not gardening for us
  * Think about this.  People spend energy making plastic trash bags.  People spend their time making money to buy these bags.  Their entire purpose is to be through away.
  * Please don’t buy plastic bags and use it for yard waste for pickup.  Use some form of biodegradable bag or just compost it yourself.
  * Find plastic bags on the greenway, use them for your trash bag.  There will always be enough.
    * Turns out this is a thing.  It’s called ‘Plogging’ and lots of people do it (In Scandinavia).
* Many plastic food containers are reusable.  This can be helpful when buying bulk and carrying them on your bike or on a plane.
* RHT Post will reuse your bubblewrap (and paper).  Consider clicking the "ship my items in the fewest shipments possible or scheduling all your shipments on the same day.  That's the best way to avoid having Amazon send you nearly unusable packaging.
* Linux can breathe life into old machines


## Challenges
* Don’t lose track of your goal.  Eliminating the first 90% is easy and came make a huge difference.  It’s easy to chase “perfection” and get frustrated.
* Business trips are hard.  Many of these techniques are hard to do until you're familiar with a city.
* Not having everything delivered to my doorstep form Amazon, Vitacost and Costco
* Microfibers from clothing is one of the biggest dangers to our oceans.  Changing your wardrobe takes time
* Even at places like Whole Foods there are stickers on most produce.  Ask them to stop doing that.  They listen.
* Behind the scenes plastic consumption: The FDA requires meat packaged in plastic.  The best we can do in many cases is prevent meat from being wrapped in plastic, unwrapped and then rewrapped.
